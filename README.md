# üå≤ WildLight

Step into a world where survival meets subtle beauty. In WildLight, every sound, texture, and detail is crafted to pull you deeper into a refined Minecraft experience. Explore vast landscapes, survive harsh conditions, and uncover the forgotten logic of a world shaped by realism. This is not just Vanilla ‚Äî it‚Äôs nature, reborn through immersion.

## ‚ú® Features

### üéß Enhanced soundscapes and ambient effects ‚ú®

Put on your headphones and listen to the beautiful, magical sounds of nature. With mods like **AmbientSounds** for natural ambience, **Presence Footsteps** that add unique walking sounds, and **Sound Physics Remastered** which makes audio more realistic, you'll feel more immersed in the game more than ever before.

For visuals, countless new particles and stunning shaders make the world more breathtaking than ever. **Particular** add beautiful little animations that make the game feel alive, with waterfalls, falling leaves, and so much more. I also love **Subtle Effect**, it makes fire look truly magical. And of course, with **Iris** for shaders and **Complementary Unbound** enhanced by **Euphoria Patches**, every visual detail looks absolutely incredible.

### üåÑ Diverse new landscapes and discoveries üîç

Create a new world and discover the richness of the new biomes added by **Biomes O' Plenty**, which introduces a ton of diverse biomes. The Nether also features new biomes thanks to **Pyrellium**. There's also **Wilder Wild**, which adds new biomes and structures to make the world feel even more realistic.

Throughout your world, you'll also encounter many new or revamped structures. **Towns and Towers** adds new villages and pillages outposts, while the End hasn't been forgotten, **Moog's End Structures** brings fresh exploration opportunities there as well. Several Vanilla structures have also been revamped with the **YUNG's** mods.

### ‚ú® Intuitive quality-of-life improvements üß¨

Countless QoL mods have been added, each playing an important role in the modpack. The essential **AppleSkin** shows you the potential hunger restored while holding food. **Auto HUD** lets you admire the beautiful world by automatically hiding and showing the hotbar, and as a complement, **Dynamic Crosshair** displays useful information right on your crosshair.

There are also many "Better" mods, but **Better Third Person** is especially great if you enjoy playing in third person. If you prefer the first-person view, **First-person Model** allows you to see your own body just like in real life. Another excellent QoL mod is **InvMove**, which lets you move while using your inventory.

In game, you'll never see annoying pop-ups, but if you prefer having them, you can easily configure toasts in the **No More Pop-ups** config via **Mod Menu**.

### üìà An optimized experience üîß

You don't have 32Gb RAM, a powerful graphic card, or a high-end chip? No problem! Many mods are included to optimize Minecraft's performance, **Sodium** is one of the most well-known. But there is also **Dynamic FPS**, which reduces memory usage when the game window is unfocused. **ImmediatelyFast** optimizes all immediate mode rendering, while **Concurrent Chunk Management Engine** improves chunk performance. **Entity Culling** is also used to hide blocks and entities that aren't visible.

You can check **Opions Profiles** menu to instantly load custom settings based on your PC's performance. There are 4 presets available:

- Default: The default setup (tested on a Mac Mini M2)
- Performance: No shaders, fast rendering, maximum possible FPS
- Balanced: Uses shaders, offers a middle ground between Performance and Quality
- Quality: Uses shaders, provides maximum visual fidelity, best for powewrful PCs

### üé® A fresh look at a beautiful UI ‚ú®

The new UI starts at the launch of the game, a little but appreciated mod **Dark Loading Screen**, after, you'll remark a revisited menu thanks to **FancyMenu**. All the GUI has also changed by the **Recolourfull Containers GUI + HUD (DARK)** resource pack. You'll also notice that there are a lot of icons into the buttons, they are created by **Icons**. All this new UI is now smooth when they appeared (**Smooth Gui**), when you scroll (**Smooth Scrolling**) and more. Some resource packs and mods has little UI bugs, so I created **WildLight compat** mod to patch them manually for a better experience.

### üõú Multiplayer üåç

This modpack is great to play solo, but it's even better to enjoy with friends using [Wabbanode](http://wabbanode.com/affiliate/wildlight). Several mods are included to enhance the multiplayer experience.

For chat, **Better Selection** makes texte asier and more pleasant to select, while **Chat Heads** displays player avatar in the chat, just like profile pictures next to message. And finally, I know how annoying it is when you accidentally hit a friend and all the dogs start attacking each other. Now you can calm them down with **Calm down, dog**.
